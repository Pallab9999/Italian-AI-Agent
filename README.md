# Italian-AI-Agent
A real-time voice intelligence tool designed for non-native speakers to navigate complex group conversations. This agent uses Voice Activity Detection (VAD) to listen for natural pauses, separates multiple speakers (diarization), and provides an instant bilingual transcript of Italian dialogue and its English meaning.
